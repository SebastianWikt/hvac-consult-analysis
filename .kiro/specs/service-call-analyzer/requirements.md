# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is a Django-based web application for analyzing service call recordings. The application displays call transcripts organized by conversation stages alongside compliance analysis and custom insights. The interface provides an intuitive single-page layout where users can navigate through different sections of the call and review analysis data in real-time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a service manager, I want to view call transcripts organized by conversation stages, so that I can easily follow the flow of the service call.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the call transcript grouped by stages (Introduction, Problem Diagnosis, Solution Explanation, etc.)
2. WHEN viewing transcript sections THEN the system SHALL show utterances chronologically within each stage
3. WHEN displaying utterances THEN the system SHALL show speaker identification, timestamps, and text content
4. WHEN displaying speakers THEN the system SHALL use different colors (green for Tech, blue for Customer)
5. WHEN scrolling through the transcript THEN the system SHALL provide smooth navigation between sections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a service manager, I want to navigate quickly to specific sections of the call, so that I can focus on particular aspects of the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a navigation menu with all call stages
2. WHEN clicking on a stage in the navigation THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to that section
3. WHEN scrolling through the page THEN the system SHALL highlight the current section in the navigation
4. WHEN viewing long transcripts THEN the system SHALL provide line number references for easy navigation
5. WHEN navigating between sections THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling animations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a service manager, I want to see compliance analysis for each call stage, so that I can evaluate service quality and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing each call stage THEN the system SHALL display the compliance score out of maximum points
2. WHEN compliance data exists THEN the system SHALL show evidence excerpts from the transcript
3. WHEN compliance issues are identified THEN the system SHALL display improvement suggestions
4. WHEN no compliance data exists for a stage THEN the system SHALL indicate this clearly
5. WHEN displaying analysis THEN the system SHALL present data in a clean, readable format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a service manager, I want to view custom analysis insights alongside automated compliance data, so that I can get comprehensive evaluation of the service call.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing analysis sections THEN the system SHALL display both automated compliance data and custom analysis
2. WHEN custom analysis exists THEN the system SHALL load it from a static configuration file
3. WHEN updating custom analysis THEN the system SHALL allow editing through static files without database changes
4. WHEN displaying analysis THEN the system SHALL clearly separate automated and custom insights
5. WHEN no custom analysis exists THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle missing data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a service manager, I want a responsive and visually appealing interface, so that I can efficiently review call data on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, modern interface using a CSS framework
2. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive layout
3. WHEN scrolling through content THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and transitions
4. WHEN displaying large amounts of text THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and proper spacing
5. WHEN loading the page THEN the system SHALL present content in an organized two-column layout (transcript left, analysis right)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a service manager, I want the application to handle call data from JSON files, so that I can analyze different service calls without database complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load call data from JSON files
2. WHEN JSON data is malformed THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
3. WHEN call data is missing THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN processing utterances THEN the system SHALL correctly parse speaker, timestamp, and stage information
5. WHEN loading compliance data THEN the system SHALL extract scores, evidence, and suggestions correctly
