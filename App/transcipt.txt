Hello.
Hey, Luis. Got you all done.
The reason that took so long is I just kind of also built all your equipment options when I was out there too.

Okay, sure. I'd love to wrap up with you here.
Of course, of course.

So what are you up to for the rest of the day?
Oh, keep working. Yeah, most of the day.
Sometimes I literally can't work from anywhere else but your home.
I know. Yeah.

AI is a big thing, man.
But let's go right to the differences here.
I just wanted to show you.

Remember before how we had that below freezing temperature at 41?
It's good to see.
And now we have that 20-degree difference as well.
Did a really fancy charge there for you and got you in good shape.

All that to say, definitely. Bandaid.
Sure. Yeah.
It is old. It's an old unit.

When it comes to what to expect in the future, I would say month to two months—maybe even sooner—we'll start to see the efficiency drop again.
And we still have those mold issues.

I did just want to show you some different equipment options.
Of course.

Oh my goodness. Who is this?
Yeah, this is Michelangelo.
Michelangelo! I love cats. Get out of here. Aww.
I have two cats and three dogs at home, so we have quite the chaos household.
We have two cats.
There you go.

So the two equipment options—or there's a total of four that I built.
There's either we replace like-for-like, which will naturally be more efficient, even though it's just going to be the updated version of what you have.
It's going to be a new furnace, new coil, new condenser, higher SEER rating, better efficiency, but still the same type of equipment.

The next step beyond that is maintaining gas heating, electric cooling, but upgrading efficiency.
Interestingly, that actually ends up being the most expensive one of the four that I've built.

Are you familiar with natural gas phase-outs?
No.
Okay.

So it is something like, let's say, for instance, we have stove tops being phased out.
We do have gas water heaters being phased out.
We have gas furnaces being phased out.

Are you familiar with what California's goal is?
Yeah, some of that.
Yeah, I like the idea. It's just kind of a lot.

They want every house to have a 200-amp panel, have a backup generator.
They want every house to have solar, and they want every house to have a heat pump.
Heat pumps are the next option.

Heat pumps actually just got introduced with more rebates.
Even though those are the best possible system to install, weirdly enough, those actually are getting quite affordable at the moment.
I'm used to them being our most expensive option.
But rebates have made it a lot more reasonable.

Then, when it comes to the two different heating options, I just have two different types of heat pumps that I'm building for you.
So let's just look at higher efficiency and then two different—still same technology—and then two heat pumps.

Exactly.

To start off with, it's always important to realize these are more expensive investments than your normal investment into a home.
So I just wanted you to understand that a lot of our clients use different monthly options to take care of them.

But let's just break down what we do.
Let's start off with the like-for-like.
We always come with our guarantees—really excellent guarantees that show you we'll do a great job.

First cost: newest Nest thermostat.
We can switch this up; I just wanted to simplify it.
It will be the most modern version.
We credit this back toward replacement at the very end, so this $549 will be credited back toward you.

Then we talk about steps: AC removal, haul away and disposal, heater removal.
This is typically roughly one day of work.
We remove, safely demolish, and dispose of your furnace.
Remove refrigerant, demolish and dispose of your AC.

Next: sometimes when we have water damage, I do see decayed plywood where there could be mold growth.
If we see anything like that, we cut that plywood out and put new plywood in.

The new system may not be the same dimensions—it might be a little smaller, wider, or taller.
We have to make sure the sheet-metal connections fit.
We do any sheet-metal necessary.

Outside we have a fuse box.
We remove it and work on it safely, put a new one in for you.
All the new electrical.
There's a little on/off switch called a safety shut-off—we always come with a new one.

Any new thermostat wiring or connections, any new electrical whips—we install that.
Circuit breakers on the AC—we include a brand new circuit breaker.
Thermostat wire, communication wire—if we need to rerun a thermostat wire, we absolutely would.

HVAC permits—we always pull permits.
There’s usually a HERS test as well.
Have you ever heard of that before?
No.
It's a home efficiency test.

I know right now your home would not pass a HERS test because of the condition of the ducting and some of your insulation.
We love to do HERS tests, but to feel confident we’d need to do a little work on your ducting or consider modifying it.

We do have a promotion for sealing your ductwork—no replacement, just sealing every connection.
Then we can include a test.

This is the total cost before R&E discounts.
I have a fair amount of discounts included.

This is the like-for-like option.
It comes with the newest R32 refrigerant—better for the environment, less harmful to the ozone.
35% cooling savings, 30% heating savings.
SEER rating up from your current 12 to 15.
Standard filtration.
Improved fan motor—more reliable and quieter.

10-year manufacturer warranty, 10-year compressor warranty.
If you're on our maintenance program, we match the manufacturer warranty: 10 years parts and labor.

Next, the first heat pump.
Similar line items.

The technology here is called an inverter.
Have you heard of an inverter before?
I have.
Actually, your mini split mimics that technology but ductless.
This one has that same type of inverter technology where it ramps up and down, attached to the ductwork.

Main difference: it heats and cools a little differently.
Cooling will be significantly better—usually about 60% utility bill savings.
Heating side is important to note: they don't get as hot as old gas furnaces but are totally capable.

Everything else is the same: AC removal, haul away, heater removal, plywood, circuit breaker, thermostat, permit.

Price before discounts or rebates.
Then discounts and rebates:

• $1,800 off for reusing the copper line set (if crew determines there's a leak, we still take care of it).
• Thermostat credit back toward you.
• Silicon Valley Clean Energy: $2,500 off toward heat-pump updates (you just need to submit a full PG&E bill).
• TECH rebate: $1,500 off (requires a HERS test).

As long as you have no failed permits, you should pass.

The next option is roughly the same price as gas, actually a little less expensive.

Our best possible heat pump is a Daikin.
We love Daikin—great partnership and worldwide training.

Bryant has a special feature: heat pumps sometimes enter a defrost cycle.
Bryant coils reduce that need.
Only enters defrost at 18°F, which we don’t reach in California.

Attic vs. closet installation:
Attic gives you a full closet but adds cost—at least $4,000, more if new ductwork is required.
Serviceability and efficiency are best in the closet.

Moving to the garage would be harder and would require replacing all ductwork.

Noise: our systems are very quiet.
Swapping the intake grill to an “egg-crate” style reduces noise by ~20%.
Inverter systems can be almost silent.

Install time: heat pump ~2–3 days, gas system ~1–2 days.
Duct sealing adds close to a day.

Financing:
• 120 months at 8.99% with autopay.
• 180 months at 9.99%.
• 12 months no interest (if paid in full within a year).

For the Bosch unit (which vents upward):
• 60 months is about $335/month.
• With the 12-month no-interest plan, paying it off in a year is a bit over $2,000/month.
• If not paid in full, balance after a year is financed at around 10%.

Client: I like the idea of quieter and more efficient, no gas leaks.
I’ll speak with my wife about the options. Please email them.

Contractor: I’ll send just the Bryant and Bosch options and include the duct-sealing promotion.
Permit and HERS test included.

Client declines to sign today.
Contractor agrees to send estimates and credits any repair cost toward the future installation if chosen within 15 days.
