  "stages": {
    "Introduction": {
      "analysis": "Overall, the technician's introduction was satisfactory. Although it was brief, the technician could have been more client-friendly and clear.",
      "key_points": [
        "[13s–19s]: Explanation of lateness is fine, but shift focus to the client's needs sooner.",
        "[39s–43s]: Small talk is short; not a major point of emphasis."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Start with a formal introduction (name, company, role).",
        "Ask if now is still a good time for the consult (whether late or on time).",
        "Give a high-level summary of what will be discussed, prioritizing the client's needs."
      ]
    },
    "Problem Diagnosis": {
      "analysis": "Short problem analysis. Being solution-oriented is great, but helping the customer understand the problem builds trust throughout the conversation.",
      "key_points": [
        "[43s–86s]: Explains temperature difference and emphasizes the 'band-aid' solution.",
        "[87s–108s]: Continues explaining the problem but jumps from efficiency → mold → options.",
        "[128s–180s]: Moves into potential solutions before the problem is well defined."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Begin with a broad overview of the problem and confirm shared understanding with the customer.",
        "Follow a simple path (symptoms → cause → impact) to avoid topic jumping.",
        "Calling it a band-aid solution is helpful; add a clearer explanation of components involved."
      ]
    },
    "Solution Explanation": {
      "analysis": "The solution presentation is comprehensive but overwhelming. The technician provides detailed technical information that may be too complex for the average customer to process in real time.",
      "key_points": [
        "[390s–527s]: Jumps between HERS, sealing, and rebates. No need to explain HERS in detail; leave rebates for the end.",
        "[588s–645s]: Good job tying the heat pump to something the customer understands—builds trust.",
        "[645s–929s]: Good explanation of temperature effects; rebate talk is a bit distracting.",
        "[929s–1061s]: Attic explanation is good. Miss: no numbers ready for the customer's top choice; should be more prepared or able to show visuals.",
        "[1485s–1517s]: Logistics explanation—no issues noted."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Lead with customer benefits before technical specifications.",
        "Reserve price/rebate details for the end to maintain focus.",
        "Have estimates ready for all feasible options (the attic option lacked an estimate).",
        "Use simple visuals or a configurator to show options, estimated impacts, and costs."
      ]
    },
    "Upsell Attempts": {
      "analysis": "Several opportunities to present value-added services were missed. When upselling, the focus often became too technical rather than centered on customer experience and outcomes.",
      "key_points": [
        "[199s–345s]: Upsells heat pump and Nest; includes rebates. Customer benefits mentioned briefly—consider emphasizing outcomes more than rebates.",
        "[345s–389s]: Plywood replacement mentioned but not explored; emphasize customer impact/benefits.",
        "[707s–911s]: Daikin mention is a strong trust signal; benefits to the customer should be highlighted more.",
        "[1061s–1171s]: Better upsell: directly addresses noise concern. 20% noise decrease is a strong stat; more evidence would help.",
        "[1246s–1309s]: Bosch (upflow unit) upsell aligns with customer preference; a visual comparison would help, but not all info was on hand.",
        "[1309s–1441s]: Miss: selling an Energy Star rebate required looking up availability; estimate not revised as requested. Dynamic estimate tooling would help."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Center the upsell on customer experience and impact; keep technical and rebate details secondary.",
        "Use brief proof points (reliability data, warranties, noise stats) to build trust.",
        "Provide a dynamically adjustable estimate to show trade-offs in real time.",
        "Use visuals to compare options quickly.",
        "Minimize live lookups and side calls during the consult."
      ]
    },
    "Maintenance Plan Offer": {
      "analysis": "The maintenance plan was briefly mentioned and not positioned as a valuable service. This is a missed opportunity for recurring value, retention, and warranty compliance. The link between maintenance and protecting the equipment investment was not made explicit.",
      "key_points": [
        "[480s–541s]: Offer includes a 10-year warranty and savings percentages. The customer may not understand SEER; why discounts apply is less important than the practical benefits."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Focus on quality-of-life outcomes (fewer breakdowns, longer lifespan, priority service). Mention key stats briefly and connect them to real impacts."
      ]
    },
    "Financing": {
      "analysis": "Financing was customer-initiated and handled well. Multiple options and terms were presented clearly, including early payoff flexibility.",
      "key_points": [
        "[1517s–1614s]: Clear explanation; includes Bosch (upflow) aligned with customer preference.",
        "[1615s–1742s]: Answers questions and explains options; customer acknowledges understanding."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Lead with the most popular or recommended option to simplify the decision.",
        "Provide a quick overview first (number of options, typical terms), then details."
      ]
    },
    "Closing & Thank You": {
      "analysis": "Closing was professional and respectful of the customer's process; payment for the service call was collected. However, the lack of correct estimates earlier reduced momentum at the close.",
      "key_points": [
        "[1748s–1929s]: Technician remains polite, but the deal stalls. Not having accurate estimates was a key miss."
      ],
      "recommendations": [
        "Set a concrete follow-up time (e.g., 24–48 hours) to review finalized estimates.",
        "Give a quick recap of decisions, options, and next steps to reinforce value and clarity."
